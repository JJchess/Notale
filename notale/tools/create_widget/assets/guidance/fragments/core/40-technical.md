## Technical contract — hard constraints

- No DOCTYPE, `<html>`, `<head>`, or `<body>` — output a content fragment only.
- Structure order inside widget_code: `<style>` → markup → `<script>`.
- No `<!-- comments -->` or `/* comments */` — they waste tokens.
- The widget container is `display: block; width: 100%` with transparent background; your root element fills it. Width is fluid and unknown — never hardcode pixel widths on layout containers; use `width: 100%`, `max-width`, `1fr`, `minmax(0,1fr)`. Height is content-driven — no fixed height and no `overflow: hidden` on the root.
- Never use `position: fixed` — the iframe sizes itself to in-flow content height, so fixed elements collapse it. For modal/overlay mockups, build a faux viewport: a normal-flow `<div style="min-height: 400px; background: rgba(0,0,0,.45); display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;">` with the modal inside.
- No nested scrolling — let height grow to fit. Ranked/score lists render only the top 6–8 items (never `max-height` + `overflow-y: auto`); if the data is longer, cut it and note the cut in a muted footer line.
- Scripts execute after the fragment is in the DOM. Load libraries via `<script src="...">` (UMD globals), then use the global in a plain `<script>` that follows.
- **CDN allowlist (CSP-enforced)**: external resources may ONLY load from `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`, `esm.sh`, `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `unpkg.com`. Anything else silently fails — including Google Fonts.
- Canvas does not resolve `var(--color-*)` in fillStyle/strokeStyle — use hardcoded hex on canvas (fine inside a self-contained panel).
- `grid-template-columns: 1fr` children need `minmax(0,1fr)` to clamp min-content overflow.
- Multi-column layouts: set `align-items: start` on the grid/flex container. The default `stretch` inflates a panel past its content — a square SVG inside a stretched wrapper leaves a dead band below the drawing.
- Balance column heights: in a stage + sidebar layout, estimate both columns' heights before coding; if the sidebar runs much taller than the stage, move its bottom card below the stage at full width instead of letting the stage panel stretch.
- The title gets its own row. Never pair a title with a wide control cluster in one non-wrapping flex row — the title gets crushed into vertical wrapping on narrow hosts. Controls live in their own full-width wrap row below the title.
- A small data-space viewBox (e.g. `0 0 100 100`) scales stroke-width and text up with the container — hairlines render fat and blurry. Add `vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"` to hairlines, or use a pixel-scale viewBox (`0 0 680 H`) and map data coordinates onto it.

### Host CSS variables (for `host-calm` and as neutral fallbacks)
**Backgrounds**: `--color-background-primary` (white), `-secondary` (surfaces), `-tertiary` (page bg), `-info`, `-danger`, `-success`, `-warning`
**Text**: `--color-text-primary` (black), `-secondary` (muted), `-tertiary` (hints), `-info`, `-danger`, `-success`, `-warning`
**Borders**: `--color-border-tertiary` (0.15α, default), `-secondary` (0.3α, hover), `-primary` (0.4α), semantic `-info/-danger/-success/-warning`
**Typography**: `--font-sans`, `--font-serif`, `--font-mono`
**Layout**: `--border-radius-md` (8px), `--border-radius-lg` (12px), `--border-radius-xl` (16px)
All auto-adapt to light/dark mode.

**Dark mode is mandatory** — every widget must read correctly in both host modes:
- Directed widgets (self-contained panel): the panel carries its own background, so it looks identical in both modes. Light-surface directions (paper-editorial, soft-organic, blueprint-light, studio-pop) should ship the dark variant via `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` using the values in the direction spec.
- `host-calm` widgets: CSS variables only — they invert automatically.
- In SVG with ramp classes: use `c-blue`, `c-teal`, etc. for colored nodes and `t`/`ts`/`th` on every `<text>` — they handle both modes automatically.
- Mental test: if the host background were near-black, would every text element still be readable?

### sendPrompt(text)
A global function that sends a message to chat as if the user typed it. Use it when the user's next step benefits from the assistant thinking. Handle filtering, sorting, toggling, and calculations in JS instead.

### Links
`<a href="https://...">` works — clicks open the host's link-confirmation dialog. Or call `openLink(url)` directly.

## When nothing fits
Pick the closest module use case and adapt. When nothing fits cleanly:
- Explanatory content → editorial layout (paper-editorial or host-calm)
- A bounded object (record, receipt, card) → host-calm card layout
- All craft rules and the technical contract still apply
- Use `sendPrompt()` for any action that benefits from assistant reasoning
