# Frontend Slides

Create zero-dependency, animation-rich HTML presentations that run entirely in the browser.

## Design Aesthetics

You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend design, this creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight.

Focus on:

- Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics.
- Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.
- Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.
- Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall aesthetic.

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:

- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. You still tend to converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations. Avoid this: it is critical that you think outside the box!

**Custom wildcard design rules:**

- Follow the Design Aesthetics section above: no generic "AI slop", no default font/color/layout choices, no purple-gradient-on-white clichés, no cookie-cutter dashboard/card look.
- Match the user's stated occasion, audience, mood/vibe, and content density. The custom design should feel authored for this deck, not merely "stylish."
- Make a deliberate visual thesis: distinctive typography, a committed palette, a recognizable layout system, and one strong atmospheric or graphic device.
- Keep it feasible for a full deck. The preview must imply a design system that can expand into section, content, quote, comparison, and closing slides.
- Use fixed 1920×1080 stage rules and pass the same preview authenticity checks as every other option.
- Never render "custom", "wildcard", "AI-generated", or design-process labels on the slide itself.

**Preview authenticity rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**

- Every style preview must look like a real first slide from the user's deck, not a diagnostic card.
- Never render internal workflow text on a slide: no `preview`, `generated from`, `preview.md`, `template`, `preset`, `style option`, `Option A/B/C`, file names, paths, or source-doc labels.
- Never render template names or slug names on the slide itself. Template/style names belong only in the message to the user.
- Never render user requirement notes as slide content, such as "sharp and provocative", "safe option", "bold option", "for internal sharing", or "audience: ...", unless the user explicitly wants that exact phrase to appear in the deck.
- If the slide needs chrome, use real deck chrome only: the deck title, section title, date, author, company, page number, or a genuine content phrase from the user's material.
- Before opening previews, inspect the visible text and revise if any internal metadata appears.

Apply the user's density choice throughout the deck:

- **Low density / speaker-led:** Use more slides with fewer ideas per slide. Favor large headings, short phrases, visual metaphors, section beats, quote/statement slides, and presenter-friendly pacing.
- **High density / reading-first:** Make slides more self-contained. Use structured grids, comparison tables, annotated diagrams, captions, and concise explanatory copy. Keep hierarchy strong so it feels designed, not like a document pasted onto slides.

If the user's stated needs are mixed, choose the closer of the two modes instead of inventing a middle option: live audience persuasion defaults low-density; async circulation or detailed review defaults high-density.

Never let high density become visual clutter. If a high-density slide starts to overflow, split it or redesign it into a clearer structure.

- Do not copy demo slide content or mimic the source template too literally.

- After generating, verify both content overflow and panel overlap in rendered browser screenshots. `scrollHeight` checks alone are not enough because grid panels can visually cover each other.

- Preserve its fonts, palette, decorative vocabulary, spacing rhythm, grid logic, and component grammar.
- Expand the same visual system across the full deck. Do not switch to a preset or bold template after the user has chosen the custom direction.
- Design any missing slide layouts from that system rather than importing patterns from another style.

## DO NOT USE (Generic AI Patterns)

**Fonts:** Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts as display

**Colors:** `#6366f1` (generic indigo), purple gradients on white

**Layouts:** Everything centered, generic hero sections, identical card grids

**Decorations:** Realistic illustrations, gratuitous glassmorphism, drop shadows without purpose

## CSS Gotchas

### Negating CSS Functions

**WRONG — silently ignored by browsers (no console error):**
```css
right: -clamp(28px, 3.5vw, 44px);   /* Browser ignores this */
margin-left: -min(10vw, 100px);      /* Browser ignores this */
```

**CORRECT — wrap in `calc()`:**
```css
right: calc(-1 * clamp(28px, 3.5vw, 44px));  /* Works */
margin-left: calc(-1 * min(10vw, 100px));     /* Works */
```

CSS does not allow a leading `-` before function names. The browser silently discards the entire declaration — no error, the element just appears in the wrong position. **Always use `calc(-1 * ...)` to negate CSS function values.**

### Image Placement

**Use direct file paths** (not base64) — presentations are viewed locally:

```html
<img src="assets/logo_round.png" alt="Logo" class="slide-image logo">
<img src="assets/screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot" class="slide-image screenshot">
```

```css
.slide-image {
    max-width: 100%;
    max-height: min(50vh, 400px);
    object-fit: contain;
    border-radius: 8px;
}
.slide-image.screenshot {
    border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
    border-radius: 12px;
    box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}
.slide-image.logo {
    max-height: min(30vh, 200px);
}
```

**Adapt border/shadow colors to match the chosen style's accent.** Never repeat the same image on multiple slides (except logos on title + closing).

**Placement patterns:** Logo centered on title slide. Screenshots in two-column layouts with text. Full-bleed images as slide backgrounds with text overlay (use sparingly).

## Code Quality

**Comments:** Every section needs clear comments explaining what it does and how to modify it.

**Accessibility:**
- Semantic HTML (`<section>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`)
- Keyboard navigation works fully
- ARIA labels where needed
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support (included in viewport-base.css)

## Effect-to-Feeling Guide

| Feeling | Animations | Visual Cues |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Dramatic / Cinematic** | Slow fade-ins (1-1.5s), large scale transitions (0.9 to 1), parallax scrolling | Dark backgrounds, spotlight effects, full-bleed images |
| **Techy / Futuristic** | Neon glow (box-shadow), glitch/scramble text, grid reveals | Particle systems (canvas), grid patterns, monospace accents, cyan/magenta/electric blue |
| **Playful / Friendly** | Bouncy easing (spring physics), floating/bobbing | Rounded corners, pastel/bright colors, hand-drawn elements |
| **Professional / Corporate** | Subtle fast animations (200-300ms), clean slides | Navy/slate/charcoal, precise spacing, data visualization focus |
| **Calm / Minimal** | Very slow subtle motion, gentle fades | High whitespace, muted palette, serif typography, generous padding |
| **Editorial / Magazine** | Staggered text reveals, image-text interplay | Strong type hierarchy, pull quotes, grid-breaking layouts, serif headlines + sans body |
